Ten years ago, [Dave Shea](http://www.mezzoblue.com/about/dave/) [announced](http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2003/05/07/css_zen_gard/) the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/). His original goal was “[…]to create a page that allows for some wildly different CSS designs, while coding valid XHTML 1.1, valid CSS, and conforming to Section 508 and AAA accessibility guidelines.” It is a single page of HTML that you can apply any of 213 CSS stylesheets to.

Back in 2003 seeing the power of using CSS like this with valid markup wasn’t revolutionary, but the idea of separating content and style was. The Zen Garden made people re-think how they made web sites. The internet was filled with nested tables and inline styles at the time. And just two-and-a-half weeks after Dave Shea announced the CSS Zen Garden, Jeffrey Zeldman published the first edition of [Designing with Web Standards](http://www.zeldman.com/dwws/). It was the beginning of the Web Standards Movement.

Since then it has become the industry standard to keep content and design separate, and to write [HTML](http://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) that is valid according to the standard set by the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/).


The Zen Garden was open for submissions until 2008. Considering the speed of technology on the web, it didn’t take too long for the many stylesheets there that were great teaching examples to become dated and less helpful. Fortunately Dave Shea [noticed this](http://www.nateomedia.com/notebook/web-development/css-zen-garden-html5/) (it also helped that [Jenn Lukas](http://jennlukas.com/) was around to encourage him to celebrate the 10th anniversary with something special). He decided that for the big day the CSS Zen Garden would be re-written in HTML5 and re-opened for submissions. Particularly he was looking for CSS3 and responsive design in these new submissions.

As soon as I heard the news, I sent [this link](http://mezzoblue.com/archives/2013/05/07/10_years/) to [Guillermo](https://twitter.com/guitrasher) and immediately walked over his desk to start talking about a collaboration. He sent me comps just under a week later. This morning, our design was published on the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/215/215.css). With our supported browser stack starting at IE 9, we decided to go with the bleeding edge: responsive design, web fonts, data SVG, animated pseudo-elements, & parallax scrolling.

To submit your own design, make a [pull-request on github](https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com), or use the [submission form at mezzoblue.com](http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/submit/).
